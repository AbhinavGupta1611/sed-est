Overview:

This repo contains codes to estimate SSC using several hydrometeorological and watershed static attribute data as inputs to the model. The detialed results of this analysis are reproted in "Gupta, A., & Feng, D. (2025). Regional scale simulations of daily suspended sediment concentration at gauged and ungauged rivers using deep learning. Journal of Hydrology, 133111."

Models: LSTM was used as the deep learning model and the models were developed in three scenarios: gauged, ungauged, and local
